                <h5>Since its introduction into the sports shoe market, the Air Jordan evolved from the original basketball shoes to models for different uses, including I-XXXIII. The Jordan brand sponsors 21 active NBA players, including Zion Williamson, Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony. They also endorse Nike Air Jordan products. Also they sponsor other leagues such as the MLB, NFL, NASCAR, WNBA, as well as French football team Paris Saint-Germain. With the official release on September 14, 2018, this is Jordan Brand's first collection ever with a soccer club.</h5>

                            <h5>This one is not really up for debate. While the "Banned" Air Jordan 1 may not have actually been banned by the NBA, it's still a game-changing sneaker that's stood the test of time through countless retro editions. This black/red colorway is still the boldest and best of Michael Jordan's first model.</h5>

                                <h5>Few sneakers on this list are as celebrated as this colorway of the Air Jordan 3. Sure, the Jordan 3 in general has plenty of hits, but the black/cement pair has always been the cream of the crop. While the white/cement Air Jordan 3 may have a stronger historical argument thanks to its place in Dunk Contest lore, this one always felt more special. It's also the shoe that introduced the world to the iconic "Jumpman" logo.</h5>

                                    <h5>Worn by MJ almost an entire year prior to its release, the "Concord" Air Jordan 11 was like no other Air Jordan colorway before it. Not only did it utilize a unique combination of white, black, and concord purple, but the shoe was taken to new levels of flashiness with its contrasting patent leather overlays. A lot of people will pull for the "Space Jam" over this Jordan 11, but the "Concord" has a richer history at retail.</h5>
